Early days of profitable businesses.

## Motivation

I am interested in starting a company in the near future. I think the best way
to learn how to do so is to look at the early days of profitable businesses,
not when they're already successful so that one can see how the founders
actually got started.

Here is a list of questions to start:
- What is the product?
- What is its current revenue (monthly, yearly)?
- What is the business model?
- How did the founder come up with their idea? What was the context and background?
- How did they find the right problems to work on?
- How did they achieve product/market fit?
- How did they get their first paying customers?

[Here is the summary.](company/summary.md)
