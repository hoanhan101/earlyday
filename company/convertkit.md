# ConvertKit

- Email marketing tool for bloggers and content creators.
- 5k to 600k a month in 2 years.
- Subscription.
- Used to design and write books on iOS and web app.
- Was expert on email marketing.
- Had built his personal audience throughout the year.
- One day blogged about starting a SaaS company but had no idea to work on.
  Just basically set a public goal to hold accountability. Had ideas to
  interview businesses and identify their problems. But then decided to stay
  true to his problems - a service that was better than Mailchimp.
- Bunch of similar products were out there and had huge market shares. Still
  went for it because it showed there were needs.
- Knew about 10 people who were good at email marketing. Asked them about
  their frustrations, tried to understand their why, asked if they would pay
  for a solution.
- Came back after a month with a MVP and asked to buy it - started to get real
  feedbacks, though only made 1 purchase though they all said yes.
- Focused on beginners more than high end accounts but then realized that it
  was very demanding because beginners churned frequently, asked more questions,
  took more time, money, effort to support. Then chased after big audience.
