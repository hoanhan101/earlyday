- Had software engineer jobs and did consultancy later, found issue tracking
  a problem. Most of available products were made for developers by developers.
  He built it for non-technical people, focused on user experience.
- He advised to understand the problem well and talk to customers. In a place
  where competitors were everywhere, you got to understand customers well.
- Created an open-source project to solve that at first then started a business then.
- Keep blogging and sharing.
- Focus on big wins (80/20) - channels that attracts the most customers.
