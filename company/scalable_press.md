# Scalable Press

- Efficient custom printing on demand.
- 100 millions a year.
- Subscription.
- Had a friend, Raymond, working in the time t shirt business, Teespring, was
  booming. He also dropped out the same time, but because he had made 1 millions
  in revenue selling t shirts. Utilized cheap manufacturing, sold at 40% cheaper
  prices, were price leaders. Eric joined to build their own printing infrastructure
  to a even more automated, cheaper, efficient process.
- Built the API first and posted in Hackernews. Went after t shirt business, found
  Teechip, competed with Teespring (YC). Expanded to other industry too based on the API.
